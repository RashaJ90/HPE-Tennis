# Pose2Trajectory: Predicting Tennis Player Trajectory with Transformers

This project, `HPE-Tennis`, is an implementation of the concepts presented in the paper **"Pose2Trajectory: Using Transformers on Body Pose to Predict Tennis Playerâ€™s Trajectory"**. It aims to predict the future trajectory of a tennis player based on their body joint data and the ball's position using a Transformer-based architecture.

This can be used to assist camera operators in production by enabling cameras to automatically track players without human intervention.

## Project Overview

The core idea of this project is to predict tennis player movements. Traditional methods often rely on centroid tracking, but this project takes a more granular approach by using human body pose information.

## Key Features

- **Player Detection**: Detects tennis players in video frames.
- **Ball Detection**: Detects the tennis ball's position, a critical component for predicting player movement.
- **Human Pose Estimation**: Extracts key body joints of the player.
- **Trajectory Prediction**: Employs a Transformer network to process the sequence of poses and ball positions.

## Model Architecture

The prediction model is based on an encoder-decoder Transformer architecture, which has proven to be highly effective for sequence-to-sequence tasks.

- **Encoder**: Processes the input sequence of player body joints and ball positions to create a rich contextual representation.
- **Decoder**: Takes the encoder's output and autoregressively generates the future trajectory of the player's centroid coordinates.

This approach is inspired by the success of Transformers in natural language processing and their growing application in computer vision and time-series forecasting.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/HPE-Tennis.git
    cd HPE-Tennis
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can use the scripts to train the model or run predictions.

### Training

To train the model on the dataset, run the `train.py` script. Make sure your dataset is correctly placed in the `data/` directory.

```bash
python train.py --config configs/training_config.json
```
*(Note: Command is a placeholder and will be updated as the project develops.)*

### Prediction

To predict player trajectories from a video or data file, use the `predict.py` script.

```bash
python predict.py --model_path models/pose2trajectory.pt --input_image path/to/image.png
```
*(Note: Command is a placeholder and will be updated as the project develops.)*
